## As our dependence on distributed software systems grows so does the necessity to feed and care for the data that lives within them. ## 

### If you share a collection of data will it be available next year? ten years from now? 20? ###
### Will that data still maintain its integrity? ###
### Is it he same data you shared 20 years go? ###
### What if I want to back up that data reliably? ###
### What if I want to move large amounts of data reliably? ###
### How do we build bridges from our "traditional" file systems to the non-file systems of the future? ###

### The above questions are the ideas I'm exploring with this project. They will change in form, priority and even existence as I find new queations and challenges within the work I do here. ###
